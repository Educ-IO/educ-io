The best technology is __open__, and the best education thrives in the __light__. Closed systems do little but perpetuate closed minds. We __passionately believe__ that everyone should have access to the best possible tools, everywhere.

All of our web-apps are subject to copyright (&copy; {% capture year %}{{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}{% if year != site.launched %}{{ site.launched }}-{% endif%}{{ year }} __{{site.author.name | downcase }}__) but released under a _permissive_ __open-source__ [license](/license). These apps are free software, meaning you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the __GNU General Public License__ (Version 3) as [published](http://www.gnu.org/licenses) by the Free Software Foundation.

Our branding, including our __name__, __logo__ and distinctive __visual design__ patterns (such as our use of blocks in our imagery) are __not__ licensed under an open-source agreement. This exclusion means you cannot use them without our permission. We __care__ about building our brand, and we want to make sure that our users recognise our sites, __trusting the quality__ of what we do and the time and effort that goes into making them. As such, while we encourage you to make copies (branches or forks) of our code, you __cannot pertain to represent us__, nor use our name, domain names or logos. If you wish to use our logo to link back to us, that's fine, but not in a way that implies affiliation or endorsement (without prior permission).

The source code is __freely available__ [online]({{ site.repo }}), and contributions, comments, and bug reports all welcome. Feel free to have a look!

Like all open-source systems, this site builds upon the work of others. Our tools wouldn't be possible without these external libraries, but instead of hiding them away, we choose to celebrate them. You can find a list of all the external libraries we currently use on our [credits](/credits/) page, including a brief description of how they are used and a link to their project website or documentation. Please take a look, and say thanks if you can.

Our site and our tools are continually evolving. New functionality and improvements are regularly added. To help with this, a [change log](/changes) is maintained for each release, making it easy to see what the latest features are and any reasons for changes & further information.
