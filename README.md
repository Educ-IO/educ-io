### Transparency
All of our web-apps are released under a _permissive_ __open-source__ [license](/license). The source code is __freely available__ [online]({{ site.source }}), and contributions, comments, and bug reports all welcome. Feel free to have a look!

### Privacy, Data Protection and the EU GDPR
All the web-apps run from this site are '__client side__' apps, meaning that __none__ of your data is transmitted back to _our systems_. The code and instructional content itself is served up over HTTPS (industry standard encryption). *Your data*, however, is loaded (and saved) directly from Google, again using HTTPS. Your data stays between you and Google Apps, ensuring it stays . We never see it, never could see it, and would want to see it. We just provide the code!

### Reliability
All of our web-apps are '__offline-first__' on [compatible browsers](/requirements), meaning that the code and structure of the apps are saved locally on your device. Where possible, data is cached briefly to speed things up (but always removed when you sign out). This means the web-apps will continue to function when you are offline, or when wifi isn't working so well!
