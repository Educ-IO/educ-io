TODO LIST 
=========
* Match slashed and unslashed urls to service worker cache (e.g. "https://educ.io/view/" and "https://educ.io/view") <-- Needs a re-work of the sw-cache
* Animated Logo
* Contrite Penguin
* Write Readme
* Write Repository
* Write Support
* Gracefully handle increasing Google Scopes (e.g. jump up to email, full drive access etc)
* Favicon Background?
* Wrap Un-Authenticated Sheets Access in Google API Javascript file
* Move bulk of YAML config from page to template?
* BUG -> Order of Dev / Multiple IMPORT Scripts is dependent on loading times - needs to be declarative
* BUG -> ARROW functions in return object (e.g. View)???
* More Sophisticated Analytics use.
* Gracefully handle authentication errors:
  + ERROR - Signed into Google {error: {…}, network: "google"}error: {code: "blocked", message: "Popup was blocked"}network: "google" <= e.g. Private Browsing Mode (redirect?)
  + ERROR - Signed into Google {error: {…}, network: "google"}error: {code: "cancelled", message: "Login has been cancelled"}network: "google" <= e.g. Close Login Popup
* Instantiate Popper in 'Normal' Pages?

Router

* Need to have a state property attached to menu items in the app yaml file. Some commands (e.g. Open) don't need to be navigated back to, whereas others (e.g. Freeze) make sense to turn off on back. Some (e.g. Toggles) will go into the back stack straight away? Others might be one removed e.g. Back takes you to the last state rather than 'undoing' an action?

Apps
----

#### View
* Write Flexbox-based Fit Algorithm
* Freeze should measure the viewport width before doing anything because 2-3 columns screws the view. Should maybe just fix the headers?
* Horizontal scroll is broken on a mobile device - don't use it, or at least default to a flexbox fit algorithm then push 'grid' view into a menu - should probably be the global default because it's a pain everywhere.

#### Folders
* File Counts
