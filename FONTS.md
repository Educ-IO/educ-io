The __typography__ of this site uses a native [font stack](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/), to ensure optimal [speed and legibility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) on your device. For headings and branding, we use an open licensed font called [Cabin Sketch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin+Sketch), served from the excellent [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) service. We also use [Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) icons in some of the apps (as well as regular/miscellaneous [unicode symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols)) to provide a familiar and consistent visual language. Material icons are also served from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
