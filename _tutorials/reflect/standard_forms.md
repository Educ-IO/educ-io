#### Introduction
{:.p-2 .border .rounded-sm .bg-highlight-light .mt-lg-3}

Reflect ships with many built-in forms. These can be used straight away or can be [customised]({% link _tutorials/reflect/custom_forms.md %}) to make your own versions.

Remember that __reports__, created when these forms are filled in, can be sent to individuals (such as tutors, mentors or administrators) for [__signing__]({% link _tutorials/reflect/report_signing.md %}) and __approval__. These people can be specified within the form itself, or at time of submission or completion.

##### Lesson Observation

A [lesson observation](/reflect/#create.report.uk_teachers_lesson_observation) form is commonly used to record the observation of a lesson. This one includes the [UK Teachers' Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} scale to allow areas of strength and weakness to be recorded against individual standards.

It includes the following:

+ __Details__ of the lesson observed (teacher, date, time group and subject)
+ Areas of __strength__ and __weakness__, correlated against Teachers' Standards
+ __Targets__ that are set as a result of the observation
+ An __overall judgement__ (using Ofsted grades) and further comments
