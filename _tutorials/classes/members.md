#### Introduction
{:.p-2 .border .rounded-sm .bg-highlight-lightest .mt-lg-3}

Our __classes__ app provides an easy way to __add__, __remove__ or __move__ teachers and students from Google Classrooms. As a G-Suite domain administrator, you can manage __any classroom__ in your domain. You __do not need__ to be a teacher in the classroom in order to do this. __Teachers cannot__ add or move students in their classes, only invite or remove them.

#### Selecting Classrooms
{:.p-2 .border .rounded-sm .bg-highlight-lightest .mt-lg-4}

The first stage to editing classroom members is to select the classroom/s you wish to manage. This can be done in a number of ways;

- If you do not have large number (e.g. less than 50) classrooms in your domain, you can choose to load all the __current__ classes (e.g. non-archived). To do this, click the __Current__ button or __Current Classes__ menu item from the initial app screen (after signing in). Once the classes have loaded (this can take a while, as teachers and owners for each class have to be enumerated).

- If you have a larger number of classrooms (e.g. a few hundred), you may wish to pre-select which classes you would like to load and edit. This will significantly speed up the loading of the classrooms. You can do this by clicking the __Select__ button or __Select Classes__ menu item. This will allow you to select which classes you want to load.

- If you are looking to edit classes for a particular teacher or student, you can choose to load just those classes which they are a member of. Click __Filter Classes__ to bring up a dialog where you can enter their email address and then load their specific classrooms. This is useful if you wish to add another teacher to all the classes taught by a specific teacher (e.g. if they are ill or have left your organisation).

#### Filtering Classrooms

Once the Classrooms have been loaded, you can use the __column headings__ to further filter them (add / remove actions will only apply to classes that are in the current displayed view). To do this, click on the column headings and start to __enter your filter text__ in the filters. Full filter instructions can be found by clicking on the column name button on the left hand side of the filter. Most filters will allow wildcards, so you can use parts of a name or section to filter the classrooms.

If you wish to filter by teachers, you can do this too using the __Teachers__ column filter. This will allow you to filter by teacher name (rather than email address). You may also remove a __single classroom__ from the list by clicking on the __remove row cross__ on the far right hand side. This remove the classroom until the list has been reloaded.

#### Managing Members

Individual teachers or students can be removed from a single classroom by clicking on the __remove cross__ next to their name. You will be __prompted to confirm__ you wish to remove them. By default, the list of students is not loaded until you have analysed the __usage__ for the displayed classes. Once this is done, you can expand the student column (to the right of teachers). You may also __move__ a student to a different class (or classes) using the <i class="material-icons md-1 bg-dark text-light p-1 small">directions_run</i> button.

Under the __Classes__ menu, you can find tools to bulk add, remove or invite teachers or students to the classes in the current view. __Adding__ a member will not require them to accept an invite, wheras __inviting__ them will operate in the same way as invitations issued via the normal Classroom UI. You can add / remove multiple members at the same time (all via email address) to make management more streamlined.
