Once you have __signed in__ to this app, you'll be able to __open Your Drive__ of a folder from your Google Drive using the __open a folder__ command from the __Folders__ menu.

If you have opened any other folders during this logged in session (e.g. until you __sign out__), they will appear on the opening screen of the app, giving you a __quick way__ to open sheets that you commonly use. Just click on them to open directly, or click on the small cross to remove them from this page.

##### Navigation

Upon opening a folder, the contents of that folder will be shown in the first tab. You can open files from your drive by clicking on their associated links. You can also preview a thumbnail of compatible files by click on their names (similar to the _thumbnail_ view in Google Drive). By clicking on folder name links, these will then open for you. You can also use the browser back / forward buttons to navigate through folders you have opened. As you begin to navigate deeper into a tree of folders, a _breadcrumb_ will be populated above your tabs, which allows you to quickly jump back up to an ancestor folder in the hierarchy.

Once a folder is visible, you can do the following things:

##### Filter & Sort it's Contents

By default, you will see starred items at the top of the folder tab. Filters allow you to reduce the number of rows that you see, by applying filters to one or more columns (multiple column filters are cumulative, so they will show rows that meet __ALL__ of the filters, rather than any of them). They are accessible by clicking on a column heading, then start typing using the syntax below. Filters are _live_, so the relevant results will be shown as soon as you begin typing. Sorting is also accessible in the filter panel, with sort icons on the columns indicating the presence of a sort, and its direction.

##### Searching

Under the __Folders__ menu, you can execute a custom __search__. This will allow you to search for file types (e.g. a particular type of Office file) in the current folder (and all those folders below it) using regular expression filters for the file names. Once you have executed a search, it's results will open in a __new tab__. Once you have a tab of results visible, you can execute a bulk conversion of these items (sequentially) by using the __convert__ command under the __Results__ menu. If you have finished with the visible search results, you can also __close__ them from the __Results__ menu.

##### Finishing Up

When you're all done, you can either open a new folder or return to the initial page (with your recently opened sheets list) by using the __Close__ command on the __Folders__ menu.
