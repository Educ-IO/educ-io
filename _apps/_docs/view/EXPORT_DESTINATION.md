You can choose where your exported file should be stored. You can choose to __download__ it to your device, or have it stored directly in your Google Drive.

You can also opt for it to be automatically shared so that anyone you send the link to can view the export. If you are doing this, you might want to ensure you select a __password-protected output format__.
