Making sharing parts (what we call _views_) of your [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} quicker and easier:

+ Find data __fast__ with free-text & simple searching.
+ __Export__ filtered or non-filtered data to a variety of formats (including legacy formats such as .xls).
+ Craft your data into _views_, share with others just what is __relevant to them__.
+ Views are __always current__ as they load data directly from your sheets & include one-click column sorting.
+ __Hide columns completely__ from your _views_, & group adjacent columns so they can be __hidden / shown__ with a __single click__.
+ Track the usage of your _views_ with [Google Short-Links](https://goo.gl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
+ Use existing Google Drive sharing, for easy __secure management__ & __no extra configuration__ to worry about!

All of this is delivered __without modifying__ your original data in any way. In line with our [zero knowledge](/about#privacy) approach to ensure user privacy, your sheets data never leaves the browser and is __never__, __ever__ sent to us.
