The bundle management view allows a resource administrator to __create__, __delete__ or __edit__ bundles.

##### What are Bundles?

Bundles are specialised __groups__ of resources, which are grouped together to be used for a particular purpose.

##### What are Bundle Parts?

Consider a bundle of equipment that is used for filming. It might consist of three __types__ of equipment. Firstly, a camera will be required. Then something to securely hold / manouvre it (a tripod or gimbal). Finally, an audio microphone will be required to capture sound for recording.

If your collection of equipment consists of a number of cameras, tripids and microphones - then these form __parts__ of the bundle. The bundle will consist of 1 item (a resource) from each of these parts. A single camera, a single tripod and a single microphone. It shouldn't matter which resource is booked / available, as long as a certain number (normally one) from each part of the bundle can be booked.

##### Why use Bundles?

It makes it easier for users to book the correct equipment. The resource administrator can specify what each bundle consists of, and the user need only select the bundle they need! Just make sure each bundle has a unique and descriptive name (e.g. 'Video Recording Kit' rather than 'Bundle 1'). The name should convey the purpose of the bundle to the user, and they should therefore be able to select the bundle which best meets their needs.

Using bundles also makes the best use of equipment. By specifying the different resources which form the parts of the bundle - the Book App will automatically book the available resources in that bundle (e.g. it will do the hard work so the users don't have to).
