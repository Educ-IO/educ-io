A booking is an __event__ in your Google Calendar. You can book any resource by inviting it to your calendar event. This app makes this process a __little easier__.

Whenever you are booking, managing or viewing events they will be shown for a particular date. You can navigate between different dates using [shortcuts](#instructions.shortcuts), or by clicking when you see the icon below.
{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="swap_calls" explanation="__Jump__ the focus to __arbitrary date__. You can also navigate using __keyboard shortcuts__ or __touch gestures__." %}

For any existing bookings, you can click on the __Event__ button to open your booking event in __Google Calendar__.
