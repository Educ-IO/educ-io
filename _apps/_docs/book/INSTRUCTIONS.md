Once you have __signed in__ to the book app, you can then decide if you are booking a resource (create / view) or managing these bookings (manage).

The Book app is tightly integrated with Google Calendar. It provides an easier way to manage the booking of Google Calendar resources, and adds some extra functionality (such as resource grouping and the logging of equipment loans by serial number).

##### Creating Bookings

You can create new or view existing [bookins](#instructions.book) using this app. You can choose whether you want to book just a single resource, or a number of the same type of resources (if resources have been grouped together).

Booked resources will appear in your Google calendar as regular events, and events you already have in Google calendar with resources will also appear in the app.Booked

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="touch_app" border=true explanation="Once you have booked your resources, you can click this green button to access a unique QR code. Your resource administrator can scan this code to quickly access your booking and loan you the correct equipment!" %}

##### Manage Bookings

As a Google Calendar Resource Administrator, you can also use this app to [manage](#instructions.manage) existing bookings.

Simply scan a users booking QR code into the address/url bar of your browser, or into the shortcut input box on the manage page to jump straight to loaning equipment.

Alternatively, you can select the resources you will to manage bookings for, and confirms loans/return straight from there.
