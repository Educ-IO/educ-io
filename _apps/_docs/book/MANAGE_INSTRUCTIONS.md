The manage view allows a resource administrator to __confirm__ loans and returns.

##### What is a Resource Administrator?

A resource administrator is a user who has event editing rights to a resource calendar (e.g. has been invited to share the calendar) or a user granted the administrative privilege to manage resources.

###### Administrative Privileges

In the [Google Admin](https://admin.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} console, you can grant users the right to manage resources.

This can either be part of an __existing role__, or you can create a __new role__ for this specifically. The permission / privilege required is: Calendar -> All Settings -> Buildings and Resources

##### Managing Resources

You can create new or edit existing [resources](#instructions.manage.resources) using this app, as well as using the [Google Admin](https://admin.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} console.

##### Managing Bookings

If the user who has made the booking has a shortcut QR code, you can scan this into the 'Scan QR Code' text entry box, or directly into the browser address bar. This will take you directly to being able to log the details of which equipment is being loaned or returned.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the correct date (normally today, which is the default) and then toggle the resource that has been booked (on the left hand side). This will load all the bookings for that resource.Alternatively

On the right hand side, in the actions column, you will see the button/s to allow you to confirm a loan or return. If these buttons are not shown - you are probably not a resource administrator (see above)!

##### Logging Loan Equipment Details

You can choose to simply record whether a booking has been loaned/returned by clicking the relevant action buttons.You

To help keep track of equipment, you may prefer to log the serial numbers / identifiers of any equipment that has been loaned. Simply click __Log Loan__ and __Log Return__ from the button drop downs to do this.

###### Loan Log

When you first use the __logging__ feature, you will be prompted to select an existing spreadsheet (useful if you are sharing administrative duties with other people) or to create a new one (simply cancel out of the selection dialog).

Once you have created / opened an existing sheet, this will be used from that point onwards. If you want to clear this settings, use  __Tools__ menu -> __Clear Config__ command. You can always open your log sheet directly from Google Drive, or click on the __Open Data__ command on the __Tools__ menu.
