###### Booking Status

A booking can have either have __no status__ (e.g. nothing has yet been loaned) or be marked as either __loaned__ or __returned__.A

This allows you to keep track of whether a resource has been collected or not.

###### Logging Equipment Loans

You can also choose to __log__ the loan / return. This is useful if you wish to keep track of the __serial numbers__ of equipment that has been loaned out, and to who. If you opt to record this, a Google sheet will be created in your drive where this information will be stored.
