Notifications are a handy way to __receive information__ about when resources have been booked. This is done using the [notification](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} feature of Google calendar. This view allows you to manage these notifications for all your resources, in a single place.

##### Exisitng Notification Settings

When you toggle resources, the existing notification settings are loaded and display. This makes it easy for you to check what notifications you are already going to receive. Notifications are configured on a __per-user basis__.

##### Notification Types

A __daily summary__ of bookings for each resource is very useful. If this is configured, you will receive an email (first thing in the morning) for all the bookings that day. The email will contain booking information for all toggled / configured resources.

If your users tend to book on the same day (and you have a __low volume__), you may wish to get notifications when bookings are made or changed. For __higher volume__ scenarios, it is probably better to avoid notifications and rely on solely using the web-app to keep track of bookings.
