A part needs a __numerical sequence number__ (normally the next sequence number will be suggested, although this can be changed to re-order the parts). Then enter the __quantity of resources required__ for this part. If the bundle needs two of the resources identified in this part, enter two. If just a single item is required (e.g. a camera, just stick with one).
