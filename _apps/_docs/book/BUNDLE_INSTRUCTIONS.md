Booking a __bundle__ will create an __event__ in your Google Calendar.

A bundle is a group of resources required for a particular purpose (e.g. audio recording) and defined by your G-Suite Resource Administrator. The app will then automatically book the __correct resources__ for the __selected bundle__.

You can book a bundle by __selecting it__. If there are a lot of bundles, you can also search the the one you are looking for. The process of booking is exactly the same as booking a single resource (see instructions below). To see what resources a bundle contains, you can expand the bundle and constituent parts.
