The resource management view allows a resource administrator to __create__, __delete__ or __edit__ resources.

##### What are Resources?

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="add_circle_outline" explanation="To add a new resource, click the add button at the top of the view. Or you can edit an existing resource by clicking on it." %}

Resources are __bookable__ things, they are stored within G-Suite and have their own calendars. They have names and descriptions, and also types (these correspond to icons in the book app).

##### Built-In Types

If you label your resources using any of the following types then you will see a __custom icon__ in the resources view.

- COMPUTER
- CAMERA
- PHOTO CAMERA
- VIDEO CAMERA
- LENS
- MICROPHONE
- MICROPHONE BOOM
- HEADPHONE
- BATTERY
- CASE
- RIG
- TRIPOD
- TRIPOD HEAD
- AUDIO RECORDER
                    
##### How can Resources be grouped?

Groups make finding and booking __similar resources__ a little easier. Users can book a number of resources in the same group at the same time (e.g. I would like to book 10 Chromebooks).

You can add a resource to __multiple groups__, simply edit the resource and add the appropriate parent to the resource to make it a member of that group.

##### What are Features?

Features are __tags__ that are added to resources. They help to give further information to users about the resource (such as it's features or function). These can be added / removed when __editing__ or __creating__ a resource.
