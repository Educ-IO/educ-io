A __kanban__ board is a simple mechanism to help with prioritisation, workflow and focus. Each part of the board represents tasks grouped together by their status. __Timed__ items will not appear in this view, because they are going to happen without the explict need to prioritise them.

##### Available

This is the pool of available and soon to be upcoming tasks. This is the pool of future work!

##### Ready

These tasks are selected by you as __next up__. They are waiting in the wings to be tackled and completed! Many kanban gurus regulate the number of items in this category, so that you can maintain focus and not be overwhelmed with everything you need to do.

##### In Progress

What you are currently working on. Again, this should be a constrained list. Don't add extra things to this part of the board until you have the capacity to actually work on them. By keeping the number of items you are simultaneously working on, you can keep your focus and productivity at tip top levels.

##### Completed

These tasks are done, and worthy of gazing upon with pride and satisfaction!
