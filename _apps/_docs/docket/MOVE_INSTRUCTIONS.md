__Moving__ and __re-ordering__ tasks can be done by dragging items between __different days__ or __status boxes__.

The destination will be __highlighted__ when an item is held over it, and relative position will also be indicated by nestling the new item between existing tasks.

If valid, when the item is dropped, it will be moved and saved in the new position. You __will not be able to place__ an incomplete task in the past unless it is associated with a particular __time__ or period of the day (e.g. am/pm).
