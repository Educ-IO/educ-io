The analysis view provides an __overview__ of all your tasks (or tasks in a shared database).

##### Temporal, Week or Month

You can choose to visualise your data over a particular __temporal period__, or focus on how tasks are distributed over __each week__ or __month__ during the time scale for which you are examining the data.

##### Filters

Each filter can be toggled on or off using the switches.

- __Date Filter__{:.mr-2} Here you can select the temporal range for which you are looking at data (e.g. all tasks from the last month)
- __Project Filter__{:.mr-2} If you are using __projects__, you can filter the data by tasks associated with no projects, any projects or a specific project
- __Tag Filter__{:.mr-2} Enabling this filter will activate the filter toggles at the top of the analysis view, where you can select the tagged data you wish to analyse

By default, __timed items__ (those tasks associated with a particular date / time, such as a meeting) are included in the analysis. You can used the final filter to exclude these if you wish (to give more accurate indicators of how many tasks you are processing!).

##### Statistics

The panels at the bottom of the analysis view deliver statistics about the __number__ of tasks, the total __done__, how long they take on __average__ to complete and also the total number of allocated __durations__ associated with them (if you are tracking time with the app).
