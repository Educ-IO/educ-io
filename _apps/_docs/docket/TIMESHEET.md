The __timesheet__ view *l*{:.kb-shortcut} is designed for those who need to account or invoice for their time. If you include a duration (e.g. the amount of time something takes) with your tasks, you can use the timesheet view to easily calculate totals. You can filter by tag / projects, and for different periods of time (e.g. last month).

You can also use this view to add tags to tasks __in bulk__. For example, you generate an invoice for a client using all the tasks you completed in the last month. Once this is done, you can add the 'Invoiced' tag to all of these tasks to remind yourself that you have invoiced for them all. You can exclude these items in future timesheets but using the tag exclusion filter to make it easier to list all un-invoiced tasks! You can always add __paid__ tags to tasks as well, to keep track of which invoices have been settled. This feature is available from the action popup menu (bottom right) or the timesheet menu at the top.
