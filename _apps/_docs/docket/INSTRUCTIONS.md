Once you have __signed in__ to the docket app, your data (if present) will load automatically. If this is the first time you have used the app, you can create a __new data sheet__ instead before you start by using the __Create__ button. Your docket diary will then be displayed, focussed initially on __today__.

##### Actions

{% include_relative _docs/docket/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="edit" border=true explanation="The __edit__ shortcut button gives quick access to action and navigation [shortcut buttons](#instructions.shortcut). These actions can also be accessed from the __Diary__ menu, in the top application bar." %}

##### Navigation & Views

You can [navigate](#instructions.navigation) around your docket diary (going forward and back in time) using the __Diary__ menu, __keyboard shortcuts__ and __touch gestures__. [Views](#instructions.view) are ways of [visualising](#instructions.analysis) and interacting with your tasks. You can switch between them using the __Show__ menu or __keyboard shortcuts__.

##### Editing & Moving

To edit an item, __click__ or __tap__ on it, revealing an editable text box and [control buttons](#instructions.edit). Task items can also be [moved](#instructions.move) between different [kanban](#instructions.kanban) __status boards__ or __scheduled days__. You can add or edit __tags__ from here too, or assign tasks to [projects](#instructions.project).
