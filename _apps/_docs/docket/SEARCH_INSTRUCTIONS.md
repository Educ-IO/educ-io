Search for tasks and events, using a __free text query__. All details and tags fields will be checked. Searches that begin (according to the currently focussed date) in the past will return __all__ items, regardless of status, otherwise only __all non-completed tasks__ and __just events__ from the currently focussed date onwards will be shown.
