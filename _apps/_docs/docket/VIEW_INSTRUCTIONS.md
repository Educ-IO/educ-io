##### Weekly

By default, this is the view that is rendered when the app starts. You can change the default using __Tools__ -> __Preferences__. The week view shows __one day__ in the past (showing what you have completed), and __five__ days in the future (to show what is coming up). You can also the __focus__ date by clicking on the date header or navigating between days and weeks. Weekends are displayed as smaller blocks - because they are best reserved for doing what you want, rather than what you __have__ to do! 

##### Daily & Monthly

For a greater overview, you can swap to the monthly view using *m*{:.kb-shortcut} or the __Show__ menu. Daily *d*{:.kb-shortcut} will give you a view of just the focussed day (today, by default). The __daily__ view is useful when you have a large number of tasks that you would like to devote all the available screen area to.

##### Analysis & Kanban

These two views present alternative ways of looking at your tasks. The __analysis__ view *a*{:.kb-shortcut} gives you statistics and a visual representation of your task management over time. Kanban *k*{:.kb-shortcut} presents a status-first view of your current tasks, giving you a more simplified view of what you are currently working on.

Each item in these views may be accompanied with icons to indicate status or further information:

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="schedule" explanation="This is a __timed__ item (such as a meeting), meaning it is will happen on a certain day and/or time, regardless of whether you mark it as complete" %}

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="av_timer" explanation="These items have a __duration__ associated with them - helpful if you need to keep track of the time spent on particular tasks or projects" %}

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="hourglass_empty" explanation="Items which have been classified as __ready__ on the Kanban board, these are next up in the list of things to do!" %}

{% include_relative _docs/shared/ICON_EXPLANATION.md icon="work" explanation="Items you are currently working on, as specified on the Kanban board" %}
