You can link directly to a particular __docket database__, meaning faster access to shared tasks. A standard link is ideal for sending by email (the recipient will also need access to the Google Sheet that holds the Docket data) or for bookmarking.

##### Permalink

A permalink will __always open__ the specified database, every time the page is reloaded (e.g. when your computer wakes up from sleep). If you would like to use several tabs to automatically re-open different shared task lists, then use this type of link!
