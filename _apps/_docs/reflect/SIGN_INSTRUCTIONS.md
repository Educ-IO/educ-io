You can __digitally sign__ this report, to indicate that you __accept__ or __agree__ with the information containing within it.

A signature will appear as a __[comment](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/65129){:target="_blank"}__ on the report file in Google Drive. You can remove/revoke any of your digital signatures by deleting the comment in Drive or using the __Remove Signature__ button link at the bottom of the report.

Your signature is __only valid__ (validity is visible through this app, rather than Google Drive) for the report data that was visible when you signed it. If the report is __changed__ at all, your signature will __no longer be valid__, but you are able to re-sign it if you wish.
