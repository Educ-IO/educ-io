__Sending__, or __sharing__, your report is inviting other users to review, accept & sign the information contained within. You can also choose to add your __own message__, which will be included in the email sent (from your account) to the email addresses that you specify.

If the form that you are completing includes specified __email address fields__ (such as for a supervisor, mentor or tutor) then these will be included (by default) in the list of recipients.

As this is __your data__, you can choose who to add to the recipient list, but they will need a Google account in order to be able to review and sign your report.
