__Reports__ are created when you fill in a __form__ using this app. You can use the [__forms__]({% link _tutorials/reflect/standard_forms.md %}){:target="_blank"} that are included with the app, or [__create__]({% link _tutorials/reflect/custom_forms.md %}){:target="_blank"} your own.

A report is a file that is saved __privately__ in your google drive (when you press the save button) and therefore can be re-opened and gradually worked on until you are happy with it.

Once you are ready, you can __share & send the report__ to colleagues, managers or anyone else you wish. They can __view__ the report and __sign it__ to indicate their agreement or acknowledgement. Their signature is valid as long as the report data does not change. If you wish to change the report, you may need to subsequently ask for them to re-sign it (just as you would do with a paper document!).

Finally, you can __complete it__ and send it to an administrator, or manager, who is then able to track who has/hasn't sent them completed reports. After completion, you remain in __complete control__ of your report data - and can continue to view / use it as you see fit. As the report file stays in __your Google Drive__, you can use the regular sharing tools to see who has access and amend those permissions as you see fit.
