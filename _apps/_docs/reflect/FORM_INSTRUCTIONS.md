A __form__ is a set groups and fields that are available for users to fill in (questions, and a template to create a report).

Forms can be default ones included with the app, or ones which are designed just for you or your organisation. Any custom form will include the name and email address of the person who owns it at the top. Like a __report__, a custom form is simply a file within the Google Drive of it's owner.

Filling in a form and creating a report __does not automatically grant__ the owner of the form visibility of your responses. You can choose with whom to share your report upon [completion](#instructions.complete) or [requesting](#instructions.send) approval / signing. Just like Google drive, __you can choose__ who you want to be able to view your data.
