You have been asked to __review__ and __sign__ a [Reflect](https://educ.io/reflect){:target="_blank"} report. If you are unsure about how to do this, further instructions can be found [here](https://educ.io/tutorials/reflect/report-signing){:target="_blank"}.

[Reflect](https://dev.educ.io/guides/reflect/){:target="_blank"} is a web-based app, used to create data-driven reports which can be shared and processed like regular Google Drive files. The author of this report has __shared it__ with you so that you can __review it__. It will also appear in _Shared with Me_ in your Google Drive.

If you agree with the report content, you can __digitally sign__ the report using the __Sign__ button at the bottom of the report. You can remove this signature at any time, and your signature will only be __valid__ if the data in the report __remains the same__ as the version that you reviewed.

Digital signatures are appended to the report file as __comments__, and in order to check their validity, the report __must be opened__ in the [Reflect](https://educ.io/reflect){:target="_blank"} app. You can make this process much faster by linking the app to your Google Drive so that you can open reports directly from the Google Drive web site. To do this, click the __About__ menu within Reflect and then __Install__. You will then be prompted to install the app shortcut to your drive.
