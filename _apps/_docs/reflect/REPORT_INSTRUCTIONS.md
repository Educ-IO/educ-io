A __report__ is the name given to the data which you use to fill in a __[form](#instructions.form)__.

You can __[save it](#instructions.save)__ into your __Google Drive__, and continue to load and edit it until you are ready to __[complete](#instructions.complete)__ it. A Reflective Report file is just like any other file in your Google Drive. You can share it with whomever you want and also use it's version history to undo changes if you wish to.

When you save your report, a visual 'snapshot' will also be generated and saved with the file. This means you can preview what the report looks like, directly from Google Drive. If you wish to open reflective files directly from Google Drive, you can choose to __register__ reflect as a shortcut app - simple click __Install__ from the __About__ menu above.
