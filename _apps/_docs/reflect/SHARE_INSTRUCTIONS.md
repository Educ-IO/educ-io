__Sharing__ your report is a similar process to __sending__, but does not send the recipients a customised email. Instead, they will receive a standard Google Drive share notification. New users or users who are not yet familiar with the Reflect App might not find this sort of notification as useful as the more detailed __send email__ (as the custom email has instructions contained within it).
