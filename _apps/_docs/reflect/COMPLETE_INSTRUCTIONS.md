__Completing__ your report is the final stage. It must be __valid__; meaning any __required__ fields have been completed. When attempting to complete an invalid form, invalid fields will be highlighted in red (with valid ones marked with green ticks). They may also display further instructions about what constitutes a valid value.

Any recent changes you have made to the report __will be saved__, and you will be prompted to supply one or more recipients for the completed form (these may already be present if specified in the original form). A completed report is then __locked__, meaning you cannot accidentally make any changes. As the report remains __yours__, you may unlock a completed report using the __revoke__ command on the report menu. This can be used to correct mistakes in the original report or to add __further recipients__ to share the completed report with.

Any __evidence__ included in your report will __automatically be shared__ (with viewer permissions) with the recipients you specify.
