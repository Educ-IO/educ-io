Your __merge data__ can come from a [google sheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or a [form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Once loaded, you can filter it to ensure you are only merging the __rows that you need__. __Merged fields__ will be highlighted on the template, so you can make sure your output looks exactly the way __you want it to__.
