Once you have __signed in__, you can view the classes to which you have access. If you are an __administrator__ on your G-Suite domain, you will be able to view __all the classrooms__ in your domain.

##### Overview

The best place to start when viewing your classrooms is the overview, this can be reached by using the button on the front page, the 'Display' menu at the top or by pressing *o*{:.kb-shortcut}.

{% include_relative _docs/classes/OVERVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md %}

##### Usage

The usage column (and students) will be populated when you click/tap on the __Usage__ command (on the __Overview__ menu) or by pressing *u*{:.kb-shortcut}. Usage information will be fetched and calculated for each visible class. For large numbers of classes, this may take some time. If you wish to restrict the classes you are gathering usage information for, you can use the column headings to filter them - or the __remove__ commands on the right hand side of each row.

##### Adding, Removing & Inviting

With this app, you can __add users directly__ to classrooms as teachers or students (providing you have appropriate access rights!). To do this as an administrator, you must invite users at your domain. __External users__ (such as personal Gmail address or other G-Suite domains) can only be __invited__.

Using the commands under the __Classes__ menu, users will be added / removed from __all__ the visible classes (use filters, or the remove commands to filter). You can opt to add / remove multiple users at the same time by providing their email addresses on __individual lines__.

If you would like to remove a teacher or student from an individual classroom, you should use the remove command (a small x) next to each person in the relevant table cell.
