{% capture text %}Thanks for logging in, let's __get started__. You can use the menus above, or the buttons below to jump straight in. If you haven't used this app before, it might be worth __pausing for a moment__ to read the [instructions](#instructions). Or read our [about](/about/) page to find out more about this site, our [privacy safeguards](/about/?highlight=privacy){:target="_blank"} and our technology.

The easiest way to use this app is to __select__ the classes you wish to view, or by loading all __current__ classes. Viewing everything may __take a while__ if you are a __super-admin__ and have access to every classroom in your domain. To save time, and share analysis with other non-admin users you can __save a snapshot__ of Classes data to your Google Drive, and __load__ it whenever it is needed.{% endcapture %}
