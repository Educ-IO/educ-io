====================

-----
Contains an .md file for each app (published and in development). These are 'keyed' to the apps.yml data file, to provide information about scripts and imported dependencies. The *_docs* folder contains markdown content files for each app, explaining what it does and giving instructions upon it's use. *_sass* contains css that is specific to imported dependencies.
