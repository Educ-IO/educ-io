scopes:
  google:
    - scope: email
      name: View your email address
      reason: In order to display the address of your logged in account on the navigation menu, once you have signed in.
      request: login
    - scope: profile
      name: View your basic profile info
      reason: In order to display your name on the navigation menu, once you have signed in.
      request: login
    - scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
      name: View and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or created with this app
      reason: In order to display the Google Drive Picker, at least one 'Drive' scope is required, and this is the lowest privilege one.
      request: login
    - scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly
      name: View your Google Spreadsheets
      reason: This app needs to load data from your spreadsheets in order to display it, but not to write to them.
      request: login
    - scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
      name: View the files in your Google Drive
      reason: In order to read previously saved view files, this 'readonly' permissions is required.
      request: login
    - scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/urlshortener
      name: Manage your goo.gl short URLs
      reason: Once you have created a link to share in this app, you have the option of using the Google Link Shortener to 'compress' it. This scope allows access to that feature.
      request: lazy
    - scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.install
      name: Special scope used to let users approve installation of an app.
      reason: Allows you to install the app into your Google Drive, making opening it faster and easier from within the Google Drive Web App.
