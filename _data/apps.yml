      name : Minor Updates
      desc : Bug Fix
      type : beta | production | minor
      changes :
        - details: Lines indented with 4 spaces / a	tab are handled as code blocks in Markdown. For longer sentences, this can cause issues with wider pages and text not being wrapped properly. This version removes these before Markdown parsing to avoid this behaviour. Code blocks can still be used by 'fencing' code blocks by including ``` or ~~~ before and after the block.
    0.5.5:
      name : Minor Updates
      desc : Added checks/removal for un-intended numerical lists
      type : beta | production | minor
      changes :
        - details: When starting a line with a number, followed by a period (.) and then a space, this is parsed as a numerical list. This version removes them unless you press CTRL-ALT-P to print.
    0.5 :
      name : Minor Updates
      desc : Added Per-Printed Page Headers
      type : minor
      changes :
        - details: Using the _CTRL-T_{:.kb-shortcut} shortcut, a header is inserted which will be printed on each page.
