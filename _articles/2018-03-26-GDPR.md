#### Introduction

Despite the recent blizzard of media attention and marketing emails, __data protection__ is __not new__. In the UK, we have all been working under the [1998 Data Protection Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (itself born from the European Union's [1995 Data Protection Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). We have had __20 years__ of _strong_ legislation governing the management of processing of personal data, and __almost 2 years__ (at time of writing) to prepare for enforcement of the more comprehensive [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Working with more than a __decade of experience__ developing software for managing data in education, we have built our tools with __privacy__ and __security__ right at their core. We have not had to scramble to ensure compliance, as we have always sought to ensure that the __protection of personal data__ is at the heart of what we do.

As the __responsibility for protecting personal__ data rests with the __controller__ of that data, most organisations will be __auditing__ what services and systems they use to ensure they secure their data effectively and can prove their compliance with legislation.
{:.alert .alert-warning}

The more systems you use, the more difficult and time consuming this job will be. The more storage platforms your data is spread around on, the greater your exposure is to potential security flaws. The more accounts you and your staff have, the more likely it is that they are going to be compromised.

We want to __help you__ keep your __data safe__. We do this by providing a platform that does not __receive__ nor __store__ any of your confidential data, does __not use__ any additional accounts. We do this by making tools that help you __better manage__ and use your Google-based data. We __don't add to your GDPR compliance burdens__; we help lessen them!

#### Systems
{:.pb-2 .text-uppercase .font-weight-light .text-muted}


##### Zero-Knowledge Design

From the outset, we decided that we didn't want to store, record or capture any sensitive personal information. We wanted to build tools to help people do their jobs, not to design a business around advertising or commercial data-mining. We wanted our tools to __run in your browser__, without any need to transmit sensitive information to us. Our role is to design, code and deliver our tools to you, not to process your data. __Your data is yours__; we don't want it!

##### Google-Based Services

__Complexity__ is the [enemy](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2001/09/three_minutes_with_s.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of __security__. In building tools that don't seek to store any data, but simply help you interact, manage and work with your __existing Google data stores__, we are not adding complexity. We are allowing you to __do more__, with the same platforms. Google systems, particularly those provided for education, take [security](https://privacy.google.com/your-security.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [data protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} very seriously.

##### Security Architecture

We deliver all our web tools to you using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This means every request you make for our website, and every page we deliver is encrypted, right to your device. You can verify the security of this process yourself by using one of these respected __SSL Testing Tools__:

+ [High-Tech Bridge: SSL/TLS Server Test](https://www.htbridge.com/ssl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
+ [SSL Labs: Qualys](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=educ.io&latest){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Once one of our tools has been loaded, the communication is solely between __you__ and the __Google environment__. None of your requests pass through our servers. When you authorise one of our apps and sign-in, you receive a token (similar to a short-term password) from Google that allows you to access various parts of your Google account (these are referred to as [scopes](https://dev.educ.io/scopes/)). This token is __stored just on your device__ and is periodically refreshed (when it expires) while you are still signed in, and removed when you sign out.

This means using our apps is as __secure as your account is__. Password security is vital and we would therefore __strongly__ advise you to enable [2-Step Verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on your Google Account. For any organisation handling personal information (such as a school), this is __absolutely essential__ to make sure you are meeting your __own data protection obligations__.
{:.alert .alert-danger}

In line with almost every other website, we make use of third-party code libraries to help make our tools __performant__, __reliable__ and __useful__. We also publish [a list](https://dev.educ.io/credits/) of all the libraries that we use, and what we use them for. We load these libraries from [content delivery networks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (for improved speed and reliability). We use a cryptographic system called [SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to ensure that the code that is loaded by our apps matches the exact code we develop with and test. By doing this, we mitigate the impact of any [security breaches](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/subresource-integrity/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the delivery network, or at the original authors of the libraries. Should this occur, the resources will simply not load - the principle of 'fail-safe'. As this is a browser security feature, not every browser will support this, but you can check if which [versions do here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

##### Tracking Data

As set out in our [privacy](https://dev.educ.io/about/#privacy) information, we use [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to gather aggregated and anonymous usage statistics about our site. We do this to help us understand how to make your __experience better__. But we value and respect your decisions about your privacy __above everything else__, so this tracking code __is automatically disabled__ if you signal that you wish to remain private by setting the [do not track](http://donottrack.us/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} option in your browser.

#### Tools
{:.pb-2 .text-uppercase .font-weight-light .text-muted}

While ensuring our platform has privacy at its core, we have also designed features into our tools to help you manage your data security.

##### Folders

Using our [Folders](/folders/) app, you can mark any [files with metadata]({% link _tutorials/folders/tagging_data.md %}) about their confidentiality, importance and review requirements. These tags can be displayed automatically whilst editing files within G-Suite using our [Tag-a-Doc]({% link _extensions/tagadoc.md %}) extension. Sharing permissions for __your drive__ and __team drives__ can be [audited]({% link _tutorials/folders/audit_permissions.md %}) using this tool, giving your staff and organisation confidence that personal data is not being erroneously shared.

##### View

Our [View](/view/) app allows __simple conversion__ between Google Sheets and numerous other spreadsheet formats, including __legacy versions of Excel__. By allowing fast and efficient filtering of both rows and columns before conversion, supplying data to authorised third parties can be done efficiently but also proportionately. Easy filtering means that only the exact data required can be extracted and output, ensuring that personal data that isn't appropriate for or required by, the recipient stays firmly under your control.

##### Reflect

Due for release soon, [Reflect]({% link _news/2018-03-28-New-Apps-in-Development.md %}) will allow __performance reviews__, __self-evaluations__ and __observations__ to be undertaken, whilst storing the data solely in Google Drive. You can reduce or remove your dependencies on less secure tools by taking advantage of the existing sharing tools built into Google Drive. Staff will feel __more confident__ and __comfortable__ managing __their data using Drive__ and benefit from the familiarity of permissions management and auditing.

##### Merge

Customised documents, sheets and mailings using [Merge]({% link _news/2018-03-28-New-Apps-in-Development.md %}) provide a __simple mechanism__ for selective data report dissemination, data collection and sharing. All of this can be done using your __existing data stores__, documents and email. For small-scale mailings this provides an excellent way to avoid having to select and audit a new platform, reducing your workload and increasing security.
