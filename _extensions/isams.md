{% capture lead %}

An incredibly easy to use __Chrome__ [browser extension](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769) which allows [iSAMS](https://www.isams.com/) MIS lists to be directly opened into a browser window (rather than downloaded).
{:class="lead"}

Using iSAMS in __Chromebook__ / __Google Apps__ environment? This little extension will ensure that 'XLS / Excel' reports will __open directly in your browser window__ rather than downloading first. It's simple and just works. This makes it faster, smoother, and easier to work with iSAMS using a __Chromebook__. It's `free`, so you can grab the [code](https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/isams-extension) or install the app from the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/isams-xls-reports-to-shee/kkahfpjmfgjidhahaapadhgcnecbfckl).

It is __activated only__ when you visit certain matching [urls](https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/isams-extension/blob/master/manifest.json) in your iSAMS application (using a Chrome browser with the extension installed). When this happens, a small piece of [javascript code](https://github.com/thiscouldbejd/isams-extension/blob/master/open.js) is run when you click on the 'XLS' download link, which downloads the file for you, and then opens in a new tab (rather than just saving it to your computer). Nothing leaves your browser, and none of your information is sent anywhere else!
