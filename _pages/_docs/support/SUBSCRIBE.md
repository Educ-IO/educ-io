Payments for __support subscriptions__ are handled by Paypal. This means you can pay using your Paypal account, a credit/debit card, or even by direct debit. As the payment will be recurring, you will need to sign-up for an account with Paypal as part of the checkout process. Rest assured this is a quick and painless process, and means you can manage or [cancel]({{site.app.unsubscribe}}){:target="_blank"}  your subscription any time you would like.

You will be emailed details of your payment, and you can also __print a receipt__ (for expense or reimbursement claims) once your payment has been successfully processed.

Your payment details are __never seen by us__, but we would ask that you submit the following information so we can confirm your subscription status when you contact us for help. You can __update__ this information with us whenever you wish, so don't worry if you feel may need to make a change _in the future_!
