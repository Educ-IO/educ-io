lead: Great tools take __a lot__ of building. Using our tools is `free for everyone`, but we would encourage anyone who finds them __really useful__, or who wants __amazing support__ or a voice in their __future development__ to subscribe below.

### Free? Really?
__Yes__. These tools and the platform upon which they sit have been designed and coded to be __free__ for __everyone to use__. We __passionately believe__ in making useful things that have an immediate impact. We want to encourage __broad use__ and if you find using tools on a regular basis, or that they save you precious time, then we hope that you'll consider __supporting__ us by subscribing to our support tiers above.

### Forever?
Hopefully! The tools (in their current form) will continue to exist __in perpetuity__. They are released as open-source software. Which means, with the relevant technical skills, they can also be modified, self-hosted, and developed in new ways.

We want to continue to __develop new tools__ (as well as maintain and update existing ones) for non-technical users, this process means the commitment of a lot of time, and does require a sustainable revenue stream. We also recognise that many people will want to have the reassurance of technical support, advice and the ability to request the addition of extra features (wouldn't it be cool if it could do ...). We would also like our users to shape the development of new tools, so would welcome __requests__ and __suggestions__ from subscribers.

### Subscribing
We wanted this to be as simple as possible. We have one plan, for three 'tiers' of users. Just click on the buttons above to begin the process of subscription. It's __quick__, __secure__, and you can __[cancel]({{site.app.unsubscribe}}){:target="_blank"} at any time__.

- - -

### Bug Reporting
We welcome bug/issue reporting from all users. The best way to do this is through our open [bug tracker](https://github.com/Educ-IO/educ-io.github.io/issues/new){:target="_blank"} on __Github__ (where you will need to sign up for a free account). Subscribers can also report issues as part of their __normal support procedures__ and by __email__. We will do our best to address all bugs/issues that are reported but will __give priority__ to those raised by subscribers.

### Bespoke Training & Development
If you have particular requirements or require bespoke training and support for your organisation/users, then a variety of solutions are possible. These include __always-available remote support__ over [Slack](https://slack.com/features){:target="_blank"}, __on-site training__ and the customisation of these tools to fit __your own workflow__ requirements. Just get [in touch with us](mailto:hello@educ.io?subject=Customised Support Package) to kick off a conversation about how we might be able to help.
