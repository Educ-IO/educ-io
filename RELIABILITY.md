## Reliability
All of our web-apps are '__offline-first__' on [compatible browsers](/requirements), meaning that the code and structure of the apps are saved locally on your device. Where possible, data is cached briefly to speed things up (but always removed when you sign out). This means the web-apps will continue to function when you are offline, or when wifi isn't working so well!
