#### Introduction

[Spreadsheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about){:target="_blank"} are __awesome__. They are a _sophisticated_, _powerful_ yet easy tool to __store__ and __manipulate__ data.

Their limiting weakness is making that data available for others to __view__. Sheets were __never designed__ to be presentation tools, yet increasingly they are being used in this way. The primary drawback of sharing data is that 'sorts' or 'filters' are common to all users of your sheet, so if you hide columns for your users, you also hide them for yourself. This can be incredibly frustrating if you are working on your sheets and another user filters the data (changing what you see). [Filter Views][1] or temporary filter views (for users who have read-only rights to your sheet) can help, but they take time to set up, don't work on mobile devices and are cumbersome.

#### Enter View



#### Features

Making sharing parts (what we call _views_) of your [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about){:target="_blank"} quicker and easier:

+ Find data __fast__ with free-text searching and simple querying.
+ __Export__ filtered or non-filtered data to a variety of formats (including legacy formats such as .xls).
+ Craft your data into _views_, then share with others just what is __relevant to them__.
+ Views are __always current__ as they load data directly from your sheets and include one-click column sorting.
+ __Hide columns completely__ from your _views_, and group adjacent columns so they can be __hidden / shown__ with a __single click__.
+ Track the usage of your _views_ with [Google Short-Links](https://goo.gl){:target="_blank"} 
+ Views use existing Google Drive sharing permissions, for easy __secure management__ and __no extra configuration__ to worry about!

All of this is delivered __without modifying__ your original data in any way. In line with our [zero knowledge](/about#privacy) approach to privacy, your sheets data never leaves the browser and is __never__, __ever__ sent to us.
